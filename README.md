Check your code for data clumps and refactor them
</h3>

## About

A library to parse files and folders to check for data clumps and refactor them.

## Dataset

We're excited to share our public [Data-Clumps Dataset](https://github.com/FireboltCasters/Data-Clumps-Dataset/) with you. We invite you to explore it and consider contributing to our growing repository. By uploading your analyzed data, you can help enrich our dataset and support the broader community in their software analysis endeavors. Together, we can enhance our understanding of data-clumps and their impact on software development.

## Reporting Format

In our endeavor to ensure precision and standardization in reporting data clumps, we utilize the following specification: [Data-Clumps-Type-Context](https://github.com/FireboltCasters/data-clumps-type-context/).

## Requirements

- The project to be analyzed can not have [Wildcard imports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/147454/why-is-using-a-wild-card-with-a-java-import-statement-bad)
  - Since a static source-code analysis is made, the detector does not know where the import comes exactly from
- Node Version 14.15.6 (test on this. Newer versions might also work)
- Java 19
  - openjdk version "19.0.1" 2022-10-18
  - OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 19.0.1+10-21)
  - OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0.1+10-21, mixed mode, sharing)

## Installation

```
cd data-clumps-doctor/analyse && npm ci && npm run build
```

Optional: build the astGenerator from source
```
cd data-clumps-doctor/analyse/src/ignoreCoverage/astGenerator && make build
```

## Usage

```
cd data-clumps-doctor/analyse
node ./build/ignoreCoverage/cli.js <Path_to_your_project_to_analyse>
```

Example to analyse git ArgoUML completely:
```
node ./build/ignoreCoverage/cli.js --output /Users/nbaumgartner/Documents/GitHub/Data-Clumps-Dataset/Data/Projects/{project_name}/tags/{project_commit}.json --commit_selection tags /Users/nbaumgartner/Desktop/argouml
```

### Help

```
cd data-clumps-doctor/analyse
node ./build/ignoreCoverage/cli.js --help
```



## Roadmap

- [x] Support cli
    - [ ] Improve options and add documentation
- [x] Parser
    - [x] Support Java - PMD
    - [ ] Support TypeScript
    - [ ] Support JavaScript
    - [ ] Support Python
    - [ ] Support C#
    - [ ] Support C++
- [ ] Refactoring
    - [ ] Support Java

## Roadmap - Future improvements
- [x] Extract file parsing to PMD for speed increase: https://github.com/FireboltCasters/pmd-data-clumps
    - Using PMD will then not support web-based parsing
